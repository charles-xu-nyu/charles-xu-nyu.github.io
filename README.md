## IOS

IOS stands for iPhone operating system. It is a proprietary mobile operating system of Apple for its handheld. It supports `Objective-C`, `C`, `C++`, `Swift` programming language. It is based on the Macintosh OS X.

After Android, it is the world’s second most popular mobile operating system. Many of Apple’s mobile devices, including the iPhone, iPad, and iPod, run on this operating system. To control the device, iOS employs a multi-touch interface, such as sliding your finger across the screen to advance to the next page or pinching your fingers to zoom in or out of the screen.

`Swift` is designed to interoperate fully with `Objective-C`. Programs in `Swift` are short as opposed to `Objective-C` programs. You may choose to develop apps with `Swift` or `Objective-C` depending on your interest.
