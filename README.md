# Welcome to DSP Lab IOS Demos

This is the repository for Master thesis in 2022 advised by [Professor Ivan Selesnick](https://eeweb.engineering.nyu.edu/iselesni/) at NYU Tandon School of Engineering.

This tutorial intends to demonstrate that iphone can be used as a tool to develop cool Digital signal processing applications

2. Swift basic

## IOS

IOS stands for iPhone operating system. It is a proprietary mobile operating system of Apple for its handheld. It supports `Objective-C`, `C`, `C++`, `Swift` programming language. It is based on the Macintosh OS X.

After Android, it is the world’s second most popular mobile operating system. Many of Apple’s mobile devices, including the iPhone, iPad, and iPod, run on this operating system. To control the device, iOS employs a multi-touch interface, such as sliding your finger across the screen to advance to the next page or pinching your fingers to zoom in or out of the screen.

`Swift` is designed to interoperate fully with `Objective-C`. Programs in `Swift` are short as opposed to `Objective-C` programs. You may choose to develop apps with `Swift` or `Objective-C` depending on your interest.

## List of IOS app demos available in the repository

To try the series of demos available in the repository, you need to create a new IOS project for every demo. Follow these steps to create a new project:

1. To start with, first create an Empty IOS project.

2. After creating an empty project, you will see the IOS layout has a TextView which says Hello World!

You must be able to see the `Swift` or `Objective-C` codes in the empty project.

Now you can make changes to the default empty project by writing your own code or using the code of demo apps provided below.

Following are the list of demos available in this repository. Each demo has a readme and well commented code.
